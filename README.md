#Overview and Introduction

This repository contains mainly three files relevant for the assignment:

1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md
3. run_analysis.R

The other files are created by the programm and does not contain relevant information. The file "testing_environment.R" has been created to give me an environment to test code and order things in a way, that they work together.

#README.md
